# Docker Image for Postfix SMTP Relay with TLS

Configure with mail host name in `MAILHOST`.

Expects two files in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/${MAILHOST}`:
 - `privkey.pem`: the certificate's private key
 - `fullchain.pem`: the certificate's full chain

This very basic image is intended to be used together with any other docker image that requires a secure SMTP server to send mails. E.g. for [mwaeckerlin/nextcloud](https://hub.docker.com/r/mwaeckerlin/nextcloud), [mwaeckerlin/nodebb](https://hub.docker.com/r/mwaeckerlin/nodebb) or [gitea/gitea](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitea/gitea).

If you don't need TLS, use [mwaeckerlin/smtp-relay](https://hub.docker.com/r/mwaeckerlin/smtp-relay).

## Headless image

The image is headless: a small compiled `init` binary configures
postfix from the environment and execs the postfix `master` daemon in
container mode — no shell, no busybox, no package manager in the
shipped image. `init --healthcheck` TCP-probes the SMTP listener on
127.0.0.1:25 and can be wired as a Docker healthcheck:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "/usr/bin/init", "--healthcheck"]
```

Trade-off: the container starts as root — the postfix master needs it
to bind port 25 and manage the mail queue — and every postfix service
then drops privileges to the unprivileged `postfix` user per master.cf.

## Mail queue persistence

Postfix answers `250 Ok` as soon as a mail is safely written (fsync)
into its queue — from that moment the server owns delivery and the
sender never retries. A deferred mail (target greylisting, target
briefly down) can sit in the queue for hours or days. **Map
`/var/spool/postfix` to a named volume**, otherwise every container
recreate or image update silently destroys accepted-but-undelivered
mail.

## DNS blocklists

The smtpd restrictions include DNSBL/RHSBL lookups (manitu, spamhaus).
Set **`DISABLE_DNSBL`** to any non-empty value to strip them — for
test or offline stacks whose resolver cannot answer the blocklist
zones (each lookup would stall the SMTP dialogue until the resolver
timeout). Trade-off: without the blocklists, known-bad senders are no
longer rejected at connect time; leave it unset in production.

## Delivery-affecting limits

Both limits are deliberately high by default and configurable — a
legitimate mail must never bounce because of an artificial default:

- **`MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT`** (bytes, default `107374182400` = 100 GiB,
  `0` = unlimited): maximum accepted message size;
  `mailbox_size_limit` is pinned to the same value.
- **`SMTP_HARD_ERROR_LIMIT`** (default `20`, the postfix standard):
  hard SMTP protocol errors per session before the connection is
  dropped.

## Input validation

Every environment value is whitelist-validated at start-up before it
is fed to `postconf` or used as the certificate path segment — a
malformed value (embedded newline, a `/` in `MAILHOST`, out-of-range
number) aborts the start with a clear `invalid <VAR>` error instead of
rendering a broken or unsafe configuration. Pinned by
`tests/config-validation.sh` (`npm test`).

## SPF, DKIM and DMARC

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

SPF is DNS-only — no server-side configuration required. Add a TXT record to your domain:

```
Name:  example.com
Type:  TXT
Value: v=spf1 mx ~all
```

Replace `~all` (softfail) with `-all` (hardfail) once all legitimate senders are listed.

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM signing is optional. Connect this relay to an external OpenDKIM milter via the `OPENDKIM` environment variable:

```yaml
smtp-relay-tls:
  image: mwaeckerlin/smtp-relay-tls
  environment:
    MAILHOST: mail.example.com
    OPENDKIM: opendkim        # host[:port], default port 10026
  volumes:
    - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt:ro

opendkim:
  image: mwaeckerlin/opendkim
  environment:
    DOMAIN:   example.com    # required
    SELECTOR: mail            # optional, default: mail
  volumes:
    - dkim-keys:/etc/opendkim/keys
```

On first start, OpenDKIM prints the DNS record to publish:

```
Name:  mail._domainkey.example.com
Type:  TXT
Value: v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; p=<public-key>
```

To disable DKIM, leave `OPENDKIM` empty or unset.

---

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)

DMARC is DNS-only. Add a TXT record:

```
Name:  _dmarc.example.com
Type:  TXT
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com
```

Start with `p=none` to monitor, then move to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject`.
